# FSF_Restaurant_App_Base
My Python code for the first Restaurant App project from Udacity's Full Stack Foundations course
In this first project, we build out a server to the best of our ability with BaseHTTPServer, built around our SQLAlchemy Database.
All of our html is handles inside of this file, so it ends up very bulky and we have to handle everything all at once.
There is no templating and we have to handle each method seperately.

Doing this was a challenge but it was also cool to have it all done by hand at the base level before we move on to assignment two.

Assignment two is where we use flask to make a much cleaner codebase. That repository will be posted soon!
